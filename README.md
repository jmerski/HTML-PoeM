Hello,

I'll use the readme kind of as a progress guide for myself. 


### Use CTRL+SHIFT+T for timestamp print

Used Copilot to make a simple HTML movement 2d object. The movement was originally not smooth, although asking it smoothed it out significantly. I will start doing better on updating these timestamps and sending them to git.

Targetting path for image, removed weird characters because it couldn't be read on HTMl. I'll play around with it a bit more before trying to move forward. If I try to think about how much work there is to do with databases, actually loading a game, and making it an executable I get stressed out.

Cropping the character makes it look really good. I am really happy with the chatgpt art so far. I am going to commit this one because it makes me happy. Although I will aim for left and right. Actually emergency commit incase the new code that is provided breaks everything

Attack key works which is nice but the animations aren't great. Need to figure out how to make them based on char orientation. This is still not a realistic example of a database + real game setup.

It seems like I should only commit based on which llm I am using. A lot of the times they give bad results and that is okay.
