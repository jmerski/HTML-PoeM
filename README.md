Hello,

I'll use the readme kind of as a progress guide for myself.

Used Copilot to make a simple HTML movement 2d object. The movement was originally not smooth, although asking it smoothed it out significantly. I will start doing better on updating these timestamps and sending them to git.

Targetting path for image, removed weird characters because it couldn't be read on HTMl. I'll play around with it a bit more before trying to move forward. If I try to think about how much work there is to do with databases, actually loading a game, and making it an executable I get stressed out.
